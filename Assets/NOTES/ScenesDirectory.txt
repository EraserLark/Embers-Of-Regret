(MAKE SURE you have everything set up the way you want before doing this!)
- Duplicate 'DebugRoom', rename new scene
- Inside, set puzzles as already solved delete the keys for locks that have already been unlocked
- For locks that have already been unlocked, check the 'Unlocked' box in the 'Magic Lock Interact' script component
