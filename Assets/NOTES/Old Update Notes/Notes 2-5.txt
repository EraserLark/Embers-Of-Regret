Will want to adjust the hitboxes of things, make them bigger if possible. The mouse can be very picky with what is/isn't over.
- Might be a problem for things like bookshelf puzzle?
- Will want to avoid making interactables TOO small...

Added Raycast interaction script to the Player (Empty Object)

NEXT TO DO:
Figure out other half of interacting with objects: How to tell them what to do once you click on them.

Have Player fly to preset position based on the object they click
- Want to avoid custom animations for each diff object if possible, nothing fancy. Straight line.
- For testing right now, can specific obj for that
