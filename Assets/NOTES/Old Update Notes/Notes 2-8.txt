Coroutines look like the way to go for Player movement!

Want to change the cursor system next

Also need to figure out how to get the player to fly to a set point seperate from the object selected
- Child object coordinates might be an issue?

Adjust FOV to be wider as well? Objects far away are kind of hard to hit with mouse
- Or is it more narrow that makes the BG closer?
