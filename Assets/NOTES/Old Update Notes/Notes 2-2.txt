Game:

Plane that is .01 wide by .01 long works well if the camera is 1 above it. Anything bigger really limits the Player's view I think.

Point Light, Intensity of 1, Colored Orange parented to the Player

Questions/To Do:
- Animate Point Light on Player to flicker (Extra)

Will Character Controller work in terms of collision as we need it too, or should I use a rigidbody for it instead????

For the player flying from one location to the next, should we do that through an animation? If so, how proceed?
- Will collision still work during an animation?
