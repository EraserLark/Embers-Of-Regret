# Embers-Of-Regret

Game can be played here: https://eraserlark.itch.io/bot-sa-nova

This was created as the final project for a game design course at my university. I acted as the main programmer, with my other partners working as artists. This was my first time working on a game with other people, and I learned a lot about working with others and the importance of clear communication in a team setting.
